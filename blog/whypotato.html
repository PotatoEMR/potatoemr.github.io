                <p>PotatoEMR is a simple(ish) EMR.</p>

                <p>
                    Potato is a silly name, on purpose: it's a toy to play
                    around with, not a big and professional health platform.
                    Everyone seems to think medical systems should be
                    complicated and painful, and if you're not suffering you're
                    doing it wrong. Maybe some unholy combination of insurance,
                    regulation, and administration does make that true.
                    Fortunately, nobody actually uses PotatoEMR, so we can
                    ignore all the requirements that lead to
                    "ClinicalPlatformsCloudSynergieAI". The name should be the
                    opposite of that, to focus on fun and terrible ideas like
                    upvotes/downvotes on notes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So out of the whole world of silly names, why Potato in
                    particular? Everybody likes potatoes. They're cheap, easy,
                    plentiful, hardy, versatile, nutritious, and delicious!
                    Above all, potatoes are simple, and PotatoEMR should be
                    relatively simple. Simplistic, even. In some situations the
                    "right thing" is too complex, so
                    <a
                        href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html"
                        >simplicity</a
                    >
                    comes at the cost of completeness or even correctness, but
                    is still worth it. In practice, simplicity is more powerful
                    than feature completeness, and the potato is an inspiring
                    example of powerful simplicity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Also, that sort of grand sweeping statement is easy to make,
                    but not productive without evidence supporting or falsifying
                    it. Ideally every claim on this blog will reference
                    evidence, so claims need to be small enough to prove with
                    code and usage examples. Here's a nice small claim:
                    <em>running</em> PotatoEMR is pretty simple. It's a
                    <a href="/blog/whygoth">Go</a> server, and the entry point
                    func main() in
                    <a
                        href="https://github.com/PotatoEMR/PotatoEMR/blob/main/main.go"
                        >main.go</a
                    >
                    takes two optional flags
                </p>

                <p>
                    So you can run it with "./PotatoEMR.exe" or "./PotatoEMR.exe
                    -port=8001" or whatever. If you don't specify options they
                    default to 8000 and r4.smarthealthit.org/.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are probably a lot of legitimate configuration needs
                    this does not support, but it has the virtue of being simple
                    and easy to understand. This is not enough evidence to show
                    PotatoEMR <em>in general</em> is simple and easy to
                    understand. <a href="/blog/whyfhir">FHIR</a> in particular
                    puts the ish in simple(ish). But hopefully if you poke
                    around a bit, you'll quickly see how the whole
                    <a href="/blog/boxes">system</a> fits together.
