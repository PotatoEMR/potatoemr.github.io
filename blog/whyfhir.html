                <p><a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/"
                    >"FHIR is a standard for health care data exchange,
                    published by HL7Â®."</a
                ></p>

                <p>
                    FHIR stands for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources.
                    Here's an example FHIR resource representing a patient's
                    allergy or intolerance:
                </p>

                <iframe
                    src="https://build.fhir.org/allergyintolerance.html#resource"
                    width="80%"
                    height="2300px"
                >
                </iframe>

                <p>
                    So much for a simple EMR! Interoperability motivates a lot
                    of complexity in FHIR resources: nested backbone elements,
                    custom data types eg codeableconcept, choice properties,
                    cardinality, references, extensions, and plain old lots of
                    fields.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to defining resource data structure, FHIR
                    defines
                    <a href="https://build.fhir.org/http.html"
                        >CRUD operations</a
                    >
                    you can do on resources: Create, Read, Update, Delete, and
                    some less boring stuff. FHIR resources live on a FHIR
                    server, and you interact with them through these operations.
                    For example,
                    <a
                        href="https://r4.smarthealthit.org/Patient/2cda5aad-e409-4070-9a15-e1c35c46ed5a"
                        >https://r4.smarthealthit.org/Patient/2cda5aad-e409-4070-9a15-e1c35c46ed5a</a
                    >
                    will read the patient with id
                    2cda5aad-e409-4070-9a15-e1c35c46ed5a from the public FHIR
                    server r4.smarthealthit.org.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ostensibly, FHIR standardizes data exchange, not databases.
                    As long as everyone's data looks the same over the network
                    it should be ok if Epic and Cerner internally store data
                    differently.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, especially for a small project like PotatoEMR that
                    isn't stuck with any particular data requirements, it
                    simplifies things a lot to say ok, we'll use FHIR to store
                    data too. This saves the painful step on every exchange of
                    converting data between an internal format and FHIR. And it
                    saves us the trouble of deciding if an allergy should have
                    multiple reaction events and each should have their own last
                    occurrence time field or there should just be one last
                    occurrence field for the whole allergy. PotatoEMR doesn't
                    have existing data requirements so we don't want to have to
                    make these choices. It's nice if new projects can default to
                    FHIR without any thought or effort.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using a FHIR server to store data is a mixed blessing. The
                    benefit is PotatoEMR can easily plug into existing projects,
                    so it saves us some effort on the database. Plus we can run
                    and test against public FHIR servers which is cool. The
                    drawback is it introduces another
                    <a href="/blog/boxes">box</a> connected over the network,
                    making everything more complex and slow.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Because FHIR resources and operations are complex, PotatoEMR
                    abstracts a lot of it away into a
                    <a href="/bultaoreune">library</a>. The FHIR spec â†’ Go types
                    codegen implementation is ugly and painful, but consuming
                    the library makes FHIR more pleasant through autocomplete
                    and eliminating a lot of raw strings you don't want to
                    manually type. Here's getting a patient by id

                    Structuring medical data is the <a href="/blog/data">hard part</a>, which FHIR takes
                    care of. FHIR is pretty <a href="/blog/allergyintolerance">complicated</a> but hopefully worth it
                    for data everyone will be able to use <a href="/blog/egress">later</a>.
